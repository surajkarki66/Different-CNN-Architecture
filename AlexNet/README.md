# AlexNet
AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network (CNN), designed by Alex Krizhevsky,and published with Ilya Sutskever and Krizhevsky's doctoral advisor Geoffrey Hinton.

AlexNet competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge on September 30, 2012. The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the runner up. The original paper's primary result was that the depth of the model was essential for its high performance, which was computationally expensive, but made feasible due to the utilization of graphics processing units (GPUs) during training.

In this repo i will create AlexNet Architecture in Tensorflow in two differet ways.
* Functional API
* Custom Subclassing
