# LeNet-5
LeNet is a convolutional neural network structure proposed by Yann LeCun et al. in 1998. In general, LeNet refers to lenet-5 and is a simple convolutional neural network. Convolutional neural networks are a kind of feed-forward neural network whose artificial neurons can respond to a part of the surrounding cells in the coverage range and perform well in large-scale image processing.

In this repo i will create LeNet-5 Architecture in Tensorflow in two differet ways.
* Functional API
* Custom Subclassing
